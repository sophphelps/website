          My path into physics

        <div className="mt-6 max-w-3xl space-y-5 leading-7 text-muted">
          <p>
            I grew up in Arlington, Virginia, right outside of Washington, D.C.
            I went to Washington-Liberty High School, where I graduated ranked
            first in my class. I became interested in astronomy in high school
            after watching <em>Cosmos</em> and taking a few space science
            courses through the Virginia Space Grant Consortium.
          </p>

          <p>
            I went to UCLA for college and received my B.S. in Physics. I also
            completed the coursework for the Astrophysics major. Even though I
            had been interested in space for a long time, I actually had a
            pretty hard time figuring out what kind of research I wanted to do.
          </p>

          <p>
            I first worked in condensed matter physics, where I studied
            ferroelectric materials and nanoscale devices. I learned a lot from
            that experience, especially about reading technical papers, coding,
            and working with a research group, but I eventually realized that
            it was not the field I wanted to stay in.
          </p>

          <p>
            Later, I took a class on planets and exoplanets, and that helped
            bring me back to the questions that originally made me interested
            in physics. I became especially interested in how we detect planets
            that we cannot directly see and how activity on stars can make that
            more difficult.

            That interest led me to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I
            now study stellar magnetic activity using high-resolution
            near-infrared spectra of the Sun. My research looks at how changes
            in stellar absorption lines could help us separate signals caused
            by the star from signals caused by orbiting planets.

            My path through college was not always straightforward. I am a
            low-income, first-generation student, and I had to figure out a lot
            of the college and research process on my own. I also worked
            throughout college and helped support my family. Tutoring became my
            main source of income, but it also became something I genuinely
            cared about.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through tutoring and the UCLA Learning Assistant Program, I found
            that I really enjoy helping students work through difficult
            material and become more confident in physics. Because I know what
            it feels like to enter academic spaces without knowing all of the
            unwritten rules, I care a lot about making research and higher
            education feel more accessible.

            As I start graduate school, I hope to continue growing as both a
            researcher and a teacher. Long term, I would love to lead a
            research group focused on exoplanets while also creating a
            supportive environment where students feel comfortable asking
            questions and finding their place in science.
