          Teaching has become a really important part of my time in physics. I
          enjoy helping students work through difficult material, become more
          comfortable asking questions, and build confidence in their own
          abilities.

              UCLA Learning Assistant Program

            <p className="mt-3 leading-7 text-muted">
              I served as a Learning Assistant for four academic quarters in
              Physics 1C: Electrodynamics, Optics, and Special Relativity;
              Physics 5A: Mechanics and Energy for Life Sciences Majors; and
              Math 31A: Differential and Integral Calculus.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-3 leading-7 text-muted">
              When I first joined the program, I attended a quarter-long
              pedagogy seminar where I learned about student-centered teaching,
              growth mindset, inclusive teaching, and how to use questions to
              help students work through problems on their own. I was able to
              use what I learned directly in discussion sections while working
              with students in small groups.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-3 leading-7 text-muted">
              I later became a Pedagogy Head for Physics 5A. In that role, I
              helped facilitate the pedagogy seminars for new Learning
              Assistants and supported the LA team throughout the quarter.

              I also served as an upper-division mentor through Marginalized
              Identities in Physics and Astronomy, or MIPA. I mentored two
              lower-division students and helped them navigate classes,
              research opportunities, and some of the less obvious parts of
              being a physics student at UCLA.

            </h3>

            <p className="mt-3 leading-7 text-muted">
              Through StudySTEM, I have tutored more than 100 students in math
              and physics, from middle school through college. Since every
              student learns differently, I try to adjust how I explain things
              based on what works best for them.

              As a Physics Ph.D. student at UC Irvine, I will continue teaching
